## Quickstart
This site hosts the collection of Jupyter notebooks used to produce each figure in the paper. All of the data used by each notebook is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/64i659xalo68g44/AABX0dV2E5mxomblJr4QMS7ja?dl=1). Individual datasets for each notebook can also be downloaded directly from within the notebooks themselves.

## Environment setup
The main [repo](https://github.com/wwgolay/thermal-gs) also hosts a `thermal-gs.yaml` file for reproducing the Python environment used with conda:

```
conda env create -f thermal-gs.yaml
conda activate thermal-gs
```

## Issues
Please post any issues you find [here](https://github.com/wwgolay/thermal-gs/issues).
